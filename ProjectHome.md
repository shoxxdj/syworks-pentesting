WPA Brute Forcer is an application to brute-force WPA/WPA2 encrypted Access Point using wordlist from the specified file.

It is different from the traditional deauthenticate connected clients from targeted access point in order to get the WPA handshake. Instead, it will attempt to connect to the targeted access point using the list of words provided.

It does not require any client to be connected to the access point in order to crack.
